Counterfeit Money Detector
  This system detects if the uploaded money is fake or not. This only works with Philippine money, more specifically the New Generation Series (NGC) money. This is only a test prototype to familiarize ourselves with ResNet18 and the dataset used is only limited to using play money, not a high quality counterfeit money.
